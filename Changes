Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ParseXS.

1.99_01

 - Tests now function under all three of the supported compilers on
   Windows environments. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Will now install to the 'core' perl module directory instead of to
   'site_perl' or the like, because this is the only place MakeMaker
   will look for the xsubpp script.

 - Explicitly untie and close the output file handle because ParseXS was
   holding the file handle open, preventing the compiler from opening
   it on Win32. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added an '--output FILENAME' flag to xsubpp and changed ParseXS to use
   the named file in the #line directives when the output file has an
   extension other than '.c' (i.e. '.cpp'). [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added conditional definition of the PERL_UNUSED_VAR macro to the
   output file in case it's not already defined for backwards
   compatibility with pre-5.8 versions of perl. (Not sure if this is the
   best solution.) [Randy W. Sims]


1.99  Wed Feb  5 10:07:47 PST 2003

 - Version bump to 1.99 so it doesn't look like a 'beta release' to
   CPAN.pm.  No code changes, since I haven't had any bug reports.

 - Fixed a minor problem in the regression tests that was creating an
   XSTest..o file instead of XSTest.o


1.98_01  Mon Dec  9 11:50:41 EST 2002

 - Converted from ExtUtils::xsubpp in bleadperl

 - Basic set of regression tests written
