Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ParseXS.

1.99  Wed Feb  5 10:07:47 PST 2003

 - Version bump to 1.99 so it doesn't look like a 'beta release' to
   CPAN.pm.  No code changes, since I haven't had any bug reports.

 - Fixed a minor problem in the regression tests that was creating an
   XSTest..o file instead of XSTest.o

1.98_01  Mon Dec  9 11:50:41 EST 2002

 - Converted from ExtUtils::xsubpp in bleadperl

 - Basic set of regression tests written
