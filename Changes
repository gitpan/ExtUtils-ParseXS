Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ParseXS.

2.06  Fri Dec 26 09:00:47 CST 2003

 - Some fixes in the regression tests for the AIX platform.

2.05  Mon Sep 29 10:33:39 CDT 2003

 - We no longer trim the directory portions from the "#line " comments
   in the generated C code.  This helps cooperation with many editors'
   auto-jump-to-error stuff. [Ross McFarland]

 - In some cases the PERL_UNUSED_VAR macro is needed to get rid of C
   compile-time warnings in generated code.  Since this eliminates so
   many warnings, turning on "-Wall -W" (or your platform's
   equivalent) can once again be helpful. [Ross McFarland]

 - Did a huge amount of variable-scoping cleanup, and it *still*
   doesn't compile under 'use strict;'.  Much progress was made
   though, and many scoping issues were fixed.

2.04  Thu Sep  4 13:10:59 CDT 2003

 - Added a COPYRIGHT section to the documentation.  [Spotted by Ville
   Skytta]

2.03  Sat Aug 16 17:49:03 CST 2003

 - Fixed a warning that occurs if a regular expression (buried deep
   within the bowels of the code here) fails.  [Spotted by Michael
   Schwern]

 - Fixed a testing error on Cygwin. [Reini Urban]

2.02  Sun Mar 30 18:20:12 CST 2003

 - Now that we know this module doesn't work (yet?) with perl 5.005,
   put a couple 'use 5.006' statements in the module & Makefile.PL so
   we're explicit about the dependency. [Richard Clamp]

2.01  Thu Mar 20 08:22:36 CST 2003

 - Allow -C++ flag for backward compatibility.  It's a no-op, and has
   been since perl5.003_07. [crazyinsomniac@yahoo.com]

2.00  Sun Feb 23 16:40:17 CST 2003

 - Tests now function under all three of the supported compilers on
   Windows environments. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Will now install to the 'core' perl module directory instead of to
   'site_perl' or the like, because this is the only place MakeMaker
   will look for the xsubpp script.

 - Explicitly untie and close the output file handle because ParseXS was
   holding the file handle open, preventing the compiler from opening
   it on Win32. [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added an '--output FILENAME' flag to xsubpp and changed ParseXS to use
   the named file in the #line directives when the output file has an
   extension other than '.c' (i.e. '.cpp'). [Randy W. Sims]

 - Added conditional definition of the PERL_UNUSED_VAR macro to the
   output file in case it's not already defined for backwards
   compatibility with pre-5.8 versions of perl. (Not sure if this is the
   best solution.) [Randy W. Sims]


1.99  Wed Feb  5 10:07:47 PST 2003

 - Version bump to 1.99 so it doesn't look like a 'beta release' to
   CPAN.pm.  No code changes, since I haven't had any bug reports.

 - Fixed a minor problem in the regression tests that was creating an
   XSTest..o file instead of XSTest.o


1.98_01  Mon Dec  9 11:50:41 EST 2002

 - Converted from ExtUtils::xsubpp in bleadperl

 - Basic set of regression tests written
